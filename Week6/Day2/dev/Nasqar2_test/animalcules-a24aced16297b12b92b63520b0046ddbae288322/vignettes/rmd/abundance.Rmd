### Relative Abundance Stacked Bar Plot

The stacked bar plots are used to visualize the relative abundance of microbes at a given taxonomical level in each sample represented as a single bar.

Instructions:

* Select taxonomy level in the menu (default is genus)
* (Optional) Add a color bar for one of more sample conditions
* (Optional) Group samples and aggregate abundances by a condition
* (Optional) Sort samples by conditions or the presence of specific organisms
* (Optional) Isolate or discard samples
* (Optional) Hide or show legend
* (Optional) Adjust plot height
* Click the button "Plot"

### Relative Abundance Heatmap

The heatmap represents a sample by organisms matrix that can be visualized at different taxonomic levels.

Instructions:

* Select taxonomy level in the menu (default is genus)
* (Optional) Add a color bar for one of more sample conditions
* (Optional) Sort samples by conditions or the presence of specific organisms
* (Optional) Isolate or discard samples
* (Optional) Use raw counts or log(CPM)
* (Optional) Adjust plot height
* Click the button "Plot"

### Relative Abundance Boxplot

The boxplot visualization allows users to compare the abundance of one or more organisms at multiple taxonomical levels between categorical attributes.

Instructions:

* Select one or more taxonomy levels in the menu (default is genus)
* For each taxonomy level select one or more organisms to compare
* (Optional) Separate plots when viewing multiple organisms on the same taxonomy level
* Select a condition to compare organisms across
* Select a datatype to use
* Click the button "Plot"

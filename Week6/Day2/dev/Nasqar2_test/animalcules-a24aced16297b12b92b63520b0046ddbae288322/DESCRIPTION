Description:animalcules is an R package for utilizing up-to-date data
    analytics, visualization methods, and machine learning models to
    provide users an easy-to-use interactive microbiome analysis
    framework. It can be used as a standalone software package or users
    can explore their data with the accompanying interactive R Shiny
    application. Traditional microbiome analysis such as alpha/beta
    diversity and differential abundance analysis are enhanced, while new
    methods like biomarker identification are introduced by animalcules.
    Powerful interactive and dynamic figures generated by animalcules
    enable users to understand their data better and discover new
    insights.

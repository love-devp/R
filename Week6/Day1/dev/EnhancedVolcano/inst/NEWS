CHANGES IN VERSION 1.12
------------------------
 - added max.overlaps and min.segment.length to provide further control over
   connectors. max.overlaps replaces maxoverlapsConnectors, but both can still
   be used for legacy purposes

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.10
------------------------
 - added functionality to parse expressions in labels via parseLabels (TRUE/FALSE)
 - over-rides ggrepel's new default value for max.overlaps via introduction of
   maxoverlapsConnectors = 15
 - user can now specify a direction for connectors via directionConnectors
 - removed labhjust and labvjust
 - added pCutoffCol (via Andrea Grioni)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8
------------------------
 - added functionality to encircle variables of interest
 - added option to remove arrowheads on connectors
 - added option to rasterise images via ggrastr::geom_point_rast (Benjamin Ostendorf)
 - changed axis.text.y = element_text(..., vjust = 1.0) to 0.5 (Benjamin Ostendorf)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6
------------------------
 - removed legendVisible and pLabellingCutoff parameters
 - deprecated transcriptPointSize, transcriptLabSize,
   transcriptLabCol, transcriptLabFace,
   transcriptLabhjust, transcriptLabvjust,
   boxedlabels, and drawconnectors parameters
 - now pad xlim by +/- 1
 - moved default position of labels to be central to
   its respective point
 - added 'colGradient', which colours points continuously
   based on p-value


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4
------------------------
 - modified behaviour where a p-value of 0 is found: now
   converts these to 10^-1 * lowest non-zero p-value
 - added new paremeter 'legendLabels', which allows user
   to use expressions in the legend label
 - added support for tibbles
 - transcriptPointSize, transcriptLabSize, transcriptLabCol,
   transcriptLabFace, transcriptLabhjust, and
   transcriptLabvjust now deprecated. Use pointSize, labSize,
   labCol, labFace, labhjust, and labvjust, respectively,
   instead
 - pointSize default changed to 2.0
 - boxedlabels now deprecated. Use boxedLabels


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2
------------------------
 - added functionality to shade specific genes in the plot space (parameters:
   shade, shadeLabel, shadeAlpha, shadeFill, shadeSize, shadeBins)
 - added new parameters 'labhjust' and 'labvjust' for fine tuning position of
   labels
 - suppress warnings about removal of missing values
 - now easier to hide the legend via legendVisible = TRUE/FALSE
 - changed 'colOverride' to 'colCustom'
 - added a new 'shape' parameter to control the shape of plotted points
 - added a new 'shapeCustom' parameter, akin to functionality supplied by
   'colCustom' (formerly 'colOverride')
 - added functionality to add title, subtitle, and caption (parameters: title,
   subtitle, caption, titleLabSize, subtitleLabSize, captionLabSize = 12)
 - added functionality to add extra vertical and horizontal lines (parameters:
   hline, hlineType, hlineCol, hlineWidth, vline, vlineType, vlineCol,
   vlineWidth)
 - changed 'colConnectors' default from "black" to "grey10"
 - added extra parameters for line connectors (parameters: typeConnectors,
   endsConnectors, lengthConnectors)
 - 'labhjust' and 'labvjust' are now 'transcriptLabhjust' and
   'transcriptLabvjust', respectively
 - user can now specify to draw transcript labels as text and text in boxes
   via 'boxedlabels' (TRUE/FALSE)
 - drawconnectors now deprecated. Use drawConnectors


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------
 - user can now supply her/his/its own colour vector to label the points
 - default is to now draw grid lines and only have left and bottom borders
 - when selectLab is not NULL, even variables that do not pass the thresholds
   are now labelled along with those that do, even when DrawConnectors is
   either TRUE or FALSE.
 - correctly catches non-numeric x and / or y variables, and throws error.
 - the function now tolerates P values of 0 (zero) and replaces these with the
   lowest possible double value, given a user's specific computer architecture
   and R version.

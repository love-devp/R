	・ Agenda
		- Task reviews (Progress, issues) : Mark, Zach, Steve, Zhaorong, Onur
		- I have been making a stand-alone shiny app of Enhanced Volcano Plot.
		- Made a testing module by following the introduction of their github page
		- Working well, but I want to know what is the necessary condition for the data structure to make Enhanced Volcano Plot
		※ Do not Use "DESeq2" and "res"
		※ I can start from the dataset Zach sent me

		※ Additional information for Zach
			- In general a volcano plot should be:
				X axis: Fold Change (but log2 of Fold Change)
				Y axis: Significance (padj which stands for adjusted p-value). It needs to be the -log10 transformation
				An MA plot should be:
				X axis: Expression (you can use the baseMean column, typically people show log10 transfomration)
				Y axis: Fold Change (log2 transformed)
				To do the y-axis for the volcano plot, I use this layer in ggplot:
				scale_y_continuous(trans=c("log10", "reverse"), name='Significance', labels=trans_format('log10',math_format(10^.x))) +
				This transforms the axis into log10 space, then reverses it (which is essentially what the minus part of -log10 is doing) 
				The labels= part is telling it to show the results with scientific notation
				For the data file I shared with you, the fold change is already in log2 space, so no transformation is necessary

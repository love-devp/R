# The cause I got the crash from Module-trait tab
1. I have not through the steps of the process(Data cleaning to Module-net)
2. Thus, the shiny app does not have a record to start analysis with trait data, which crashes the shiny app.
## After I get through every steps that I need(https://github.com/ShawnWx2019/WGCNA-shinyApp/blob/main/README.md), it worked.

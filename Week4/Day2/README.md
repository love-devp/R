# Glossary

## Gene Module Scoring
	- Gene Modules: These are groups of genes that function together or are co-expressed. They might be related to specific biological processes, pathways, or disease states.
		・Purpose: The goal is to determine how active or expressed these gene modules are in different samples (e.g., different tissues, conditions, or time points).
	- How Does Z-Score-Based Scoring Work?
		・Data Collection: First, you need gene expression data, which shows how much each gene is expressed in each sample. This data is often obtained from experiments like RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or microarrays.
		・Normalization: To ensure that the data from different samples can be compared, it’s normalized. This step adjusts for technical variations and ensures that the differences seen are biologically meaningful.
	- Why Use Z-Scores?
		・Standardization: Z-scores standardize the data, making it easier to compare gene expression levels across different genes and samples.
		・Interpretability: Z-scores indicate how much a gene’s expression deviates from the average, helping identify upregulated or downregulated genes in a sample.
		・Example
		Imagine you have a gene module related to inflammation consisting of three genes: A, B, and C. You have expression data for these genes in five samples. By calculating the Z-scores for each gene in each sample and then averaging these scores, you can see which samples show higher or lower activity of the inflammation-related gene module.
	- Summary
	Gene module scoring using the Z-score-based method is a powerful tool in bioinformatics for evaluating the activity of groups of genes. By converting expression data into standardized scores, researchers can easily identify and compare the activity of biological pathways across different conditions or treatments.

## Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (sasGSEA)
	- Description: sasGSEA is a variation of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) that evaluates the enrichment of predefined gene sets in a single sample. This method is useful for obtaining pathway scores for individual samples, rather than comparing groups of samples.
	- Features
	・Single-Sample Resolution: Unlike traditional GSEA, which compares two or more groups of samples, sasGSEA scores the enrichment of gene sets for each sample individually.
	・Flexibility: This method is particularly useful in clinical settings where sample sizes might be small, and each sample needs to be evaluated independently.

## L-R (Ligand-Receptor) Interactions
	- Ligands: Molecules such as hormones, neurotransmitters, or growth factors that bind to specific receptors on the surface of cells.
	- Receptors: Proteins on the cell surface or within cells that bind to ligands and initiate a cellular response.
	- L-R Interactions: The binding of a ligand to its receptor triggers a series of intracellular events, leading to a specific cellular response.
	- Scope:
		・Molecular Level: Focuses on the specific molecular interaction between a ligand and its receptor.
		・Specificity: Each ligand typically has a specific receptor or a set of receptors it can bind to, and this interaction is crucial for precise cellular responses.
		
## Cell Communication
	- Definition: The process by which cells convey information to each other to coordinate various functions. This can involve several types of signals, including chemical signals (like ligands), electrical signals, and mechanical signals.
	- Scope:
		・Systemic Level: Encompasses all forms of communication between cells, including but not limited to L-R interactions.
		・Diverse Mechanisms: Includes various signaling pathways, such as paracrine signaling (local signaling), autocrine signaling (self-signaling), endocrine signaling (hormones via bloodstream), and juxtacrine signaling (direct contact between neighboring cells).

## Disease Enrichment Analysis
	- Description: The purpose of Disease Enrichment Analysis is, to determine whether a set of genes (e.g., differentially expressed genes from an experiment) is significantly associated with specific diseases.
	- Method: Uses statistical tests to assess the over-representation of disease-associated genes within the input gene set compared to a background gene set.
	- ClusterProfiler: ClusterProfiler is an R package designed for functional enrichment analysis, including disease enrichment analysis. It supports various types of analysis and visualization for biological data.
	
## LINCS (Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures)
	- LINCS is a project aimed at understanding how human cells respond to various genetic and chemical perturbations. It contains a vast collection of gene expression profiles, which are called "signatures," generated by exposing cells to different small molecules, genetic perturbations, and other bioactive agents.

## ChEMBL
	- ChEMBL is a database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. It includes detailed information about the compounds, such as their chemical structure, bioactivity, and molecular targets.

## Feature Selection
	- Feature selection aims to improve the model's performance by:
		・Reducing overfitting: Eliminating irrelevant or redundant features reduces noise and complexity, leading to more robust models.
		・Improving accuracy: Focusing on the most informative features enhances the model's predictive power.
		・Enhancing interpretability: Simpler models with fewer features are easier to understand and explain.
	- Methods of Feature Selection
		・Filter Methods:
			1. Statistical Tests: Techniques like chi-square tests, correlation coefficients, and mutual information scores are used to evaluate the relationship between each feature and the target variable.
		・Wrapper Methods:
			1. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): Iteratively builds a model and removes the least significant feature(s) until the desired number of features is reached.
		・Embedded Methods:
			1. Lasso Regression: Adds a penalty for the magnitude of coefficients to encourage sparsity, effectively performing feature selection.
			2. Tree-Based Methods: Decision trees and ensemble methods (like Random Forests) inherently perform feature selection by evaluating the importance of each feature during model construction.

## Variable Importance Scores
	- Variable importance scores quantify the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions. The followings are some common ways to calculate these scores.
	- Tree-Based Methods:
		・Gini Importance (Mean Decrease in Impurity): Measures the reduction in the Gini impurity (a measure of node purity) brought by each feature.
	- Permutation Importance: Measures the change in model accuracy when the values of a feature are randomly shuffled. A significant drop in accuracy indicates that the feature is important.
	-Regression Coefficients: In linear models, the absolute values of the coefficients can indicate feature importance. Features with larger coefficients have a more significant impact on the predictions.
	- Regularization Methods:
		・Lasso Regression: Shrinks some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting important features. The remaining non-zero coefficients indicate important features.
	- Mutual Information: Measures the amount of information shared between the feature and the target variable. Higher mutual information indicates a more significant relationship.

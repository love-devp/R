◎Introduction to protein and mRNAs

● Structures and functions of Protein
・ Proteins are fold up into the 3D shape
・ The 3D shape of protein determines its function 
・ Proteins are string of Amino acid. And it has 20 kinds of variety (each one contains different side chains)
・ Insulin consists of 51 of Amino acid

● Structures of mRNA
・ m(messanger)RNA is a blueprint for proteins
・ mRNA cosists of Nucleotides
・ Nucleotides has 4 kinds of variety (Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Uracil)
・ mRNA can fold into complex structures

● Translation 
・ Translation is the biological process of making proteins from mRNA
・ mRNA carries messages called "genetic code" conposed of "A, C, G, U"
・ Ribosomes are translating(move along) mRNA and making new proteins(like a factory)
・ Codons are consisted of different combinations of 3 nucleotides(A, C, G, U), such as "UUG", "AGU", "CAU". 
・ There is 64 number of cases, but only 61 are used to code for different amino acids.
・ Each combinations translates in different types of orders, such as "AUG" means "Start", "UCC" means "Serine","UAA" or "UGA" means "Stop"

● Transcription
・ Transcription is the biological process of making RNA from DNA
・ Genomic DNA can be hundreds of millions of nucleotides long (Like a book)
・ Chromosome is a big chunk that consisted of genomic DNAs (Like a library)
・ When a cell needs to make a specific protein, it copys a bit of DNA into RNA via the process called "transcription"
・ The transcripted RNA called "RNA polymerase"
・ mRNA transported out of Nucleus of cell to Cytoplasm where the "translation" occurs. It is a one way trip.
・ Central Dogma of Biology is conposed of these 3 steps: DNA→(Transcription)→RNA→(Translation)→Protein
・ Central Dogma of Biology is conposed of DNA→(Transcription)→RNA→(Translation)→Protein

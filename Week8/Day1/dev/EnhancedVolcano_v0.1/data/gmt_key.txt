H: Hallmark	human	h.all.v2023.1.Hs.entrez.gmt	org.Hs.eg.db	Hallmark gene sets summarize and represent specific well-defined biological states or processes and display coherent expression. These gene sets were generated by a computational methodology based on identifying overlaps between gene sets in other MSigDB collections and retaining genes that display coordinate expression.
